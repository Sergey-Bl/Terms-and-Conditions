entertainment and/or promotional purposes only. You may not rely on any information and
opinions expressed through any of our Services for any other purpose. In all instances, it

not responsible for the accuracy, timeliness, completeness, or reliability of any opinion,
advice, or statement offered through our Services by anyone other than our authorized

any loss or damage of any sort incurred as a result of your dealings with any third-party or

<h1 id="choice-of-law-jurisdiction-and-venue">CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION AND VENUE</h1>
<p>These Terms of Use shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Scotland without
regard to its conflict of laws rules. Any legal proceedings against LostTides that may
arise out of, relate to, or be in any way connected with our Website or these Terms of Use
shall be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts of Scotland and you waive any
jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.</p>

<h1 id="dispute-resolution--mandatory-arbitration">DISPUTE RESOLUTION &amp; MANDATORY ARBITRATION</h1>
<p>A. We each agree to first contact each other with any disputes and provide a written
description of the problem, all relevant documents/information and the proposed
resolution. You agree to contact us with disputes by contacting us at the address provided
in these Terms of Use. We will contact you based on the contact information you have
provided us.
B. If after 30 days the parties are unable to resolve any dispute raised under the
previous provision, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration consistent with this Section.
The parties understand that they would have had a right or opportunity to litigate disputes
through a court and to have a judge or jury decide their case, but they choose to have any
disputes resolved through arbitration.
C. We each agree that any claim or dispute between us, and any claim by either of us
against any agent, employee, successor, or assign of the other, including, to the full extent
permitted by applicable law, third parties who are not signatories to this agreement,
whether related to this agreement or otherwise, including past, present, and future claims
and disputes, and including any dispute as to the validity or applicability of this arbitration
clause, shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS under its rules
and procedures in effect when the claim is filed. The rules and procedures and other
information, including information on fees, may be obtained from JAMS’ website
(www.jamsadr.com) or by calling JAMS at 949-224-1810.
D. We are entering into this arbitration agreement in connection with a transaction
involving interstate commerce. Accordingly, this arbitration agreement and any
proceedings thereunder shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C.
§§ 1-16. Any award by the arbitrator(s) may be entered as a judgment in any court having
jurisdiction.
E. Exception to Arbitrate. Either of us may bring qualifying claims in small claims court.
Further, as set forth below, we each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you
and LostTides, not as part of a classwide claim (i.e., not brought on behalf of or
together with another individual’s claim). If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that
this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate doesn’t
apply and the classwide dispute must be brought in court.</p>

<h1 id="no-class-actions">NO CLASS ACTIONS</h1>
<p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE
DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE
CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A
REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT,
ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>

<h1 id="no-trial-by-jury">NO TRIAL BY JURY</h1>
<p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>

<h1 id="amendment-additional-terms">AMENDMENT; ADDITIONAL TERMS</h1>
<p>A. We reserve the right in our sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, to
modify or discontinue any aspect or feature of our Services or to modify these Terms of
Use. In addition, we reserve the right to provide you with operating rules or additional
terms that may govern your use of our Services generally, unique of our Services, or both
(“Additional Terms”). Any Additional Terms that we may provide to you will be incorporated
by reference into these Terms of Use. To the extent any Additional Terms conflict with
these Terms of Use, the Additional Terms will control.
B. Modifications to these Terms of Use or Additional Terms will be effective immediately
upon notice, either by posting on the Website, notification by email or through any of our
Applications. It is your responsibility to review the Terms of Use from time to time for any
changes or Additional Terms. Your access and use of our Services following any
modification of these Terms of Use or the provision of Additional Terms will signify your
assent to and acceptance of the same. If you object to any subsequent revision to the
Terms of Use or to any Additional Terms, immediately discontinue use of our Services
and, if applicable, terminate your Membership</p>

<h1 id="miscellaneous">MISCELLANEOUS</h1>
<p>A. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a
waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used
herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.
B. Except where specifically stated otherwise, if any part of these Terms of Use is
unlawful or unenforceable for any reason, we both agree that only that part of the Terms of
Use shall be stricken and that the remaining terms in the Terms of Use shall not be
affected.
C. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between us
with respect to such subject matter.
D. You may not assign these Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any
obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent. Any such
purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent
will be null and void and of no force and effect. We may assign these Terms of Use or any
rights hereunder without your consent and without notice.</p>
